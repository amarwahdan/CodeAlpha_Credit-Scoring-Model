# Credit Scoring Model

# Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict an individual's creditworthiness using personal and financial attributes. By analyzing key factors such as income, credit history, loan amount, and debt ratio, the model helps assess the risk of default and supports more informed lending decisions.
The model classification algorithms including XGBoost, with a focus on handling class imbalance, feature engineering, and model interpretability. The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains thousands of real-world loan applications with labels indicating loan status approved or denied.
